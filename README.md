# shape_control_DLO_2

[Project website](https://mingrui-yu.github.io/shape_control_DLO_2/)

Repository for the under-review paper "Global Model Learning for Large Deformation Control of Elastic Deformable Linear Objects: An Efficient and Adaptive Approach".

The code will be available when the paper is accepted.

Here we will provide:
* the code for the model learning and controller
* the offline training data
* the offline learned deformation model
* the built simulation environment
